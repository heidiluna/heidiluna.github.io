  lheimajökull glacier. Add even more adventure to your stay in Iceland and come explore this amazing crawling glacier with us. <br><br>

Sólheimajökull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Mýrdalsjökull and is surrounded by some of Iceland’s most grand volcanoes
and during summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only adding to the charm of the location.
This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact with the true reason behind the name Ice-land! </p>
